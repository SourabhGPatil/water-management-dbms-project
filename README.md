# AUTOMATION OF THE WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF A CITY
------------

> This project was done as a part of the **Database Management System** subject.

## Abstract
In a city or town, most houses get their water supply from the City Corporation or Water Board. These authorities usually have a water supply schedule for different areas (aka sectors). The residents of these areas adjust their water usage according to the schedule and have to manually keep track of the next water supply date. Sometimes, due to technical issues with the reservoir or the water board, a sector may not receive water on the expected day. This can cause inconvenience and confusion for the households. Our project automates this process by informing the users about the water supply date for their sector and any possible delays. If there is a delay in a sector, the local officer can notify the database admin and the water supply date will be updated accordingly. Moreover, the user can also check their water bill information and contact details of their sectorâ€™s water supply contractor. Thus, our project will provide a solution for all the water supply problems of a household.

**Project Description: Water Supply Management System and "Jal in One" Mobile App Foundation**

**Abstract:**

Our endeavor involved designing and implementing a Database Management System (DBMS) project aimed at enhancing water supply management for households. This initiative served as the foundational framework for the development of the innovative "Jal in One" mobile app. Addressing the complexities of water supply scheduling, technical glitches, and billing processes, our project streamlined water management operations, leading to efficient and hassle-free water supply experiences.

**Introduction:**

Municipalities shoulder a multitude of responsibilities, with water management standing as a vital pillar. The ubiquity and importance of water necessitate prudent management practices. A city's water distribution system hinges upon available natural resources, with its efficiency gauged by its ability to meet local needs. A well-structured network of pumps and pipes ensures the optimal flow of water. A regular supply interval aligns with consumption patterns, warranting storage and careful consumption. Managing water distribution on a regional basis is crucial, demanding an organized timetable. Our project responds to these challenges by building a comprehensive database for urban water management and automating billing processes for consumer convenience.

**Project Objectives:**

1. **Automated Water Supply Information:** Our system simplifies water supply management by providing users with real-time information about their sector's water supply schedule. Any delays or changes in the schedule are promptly communicated to users, eliminating confusion and ensuring efficient water usage.

2. **Efficient Billing Automation:** Traditionally, water billing involved manual processes and physical visits. Our solution centralizes billing, allowing users to access and pay their bills online. This not only streamlines the payment process but also reduces the need for physical interactions.

3. **Contractor Contact Information:** Users can access the contact information of their sector's water supply contractor through the system. This feature fosters direct communication and swift issue resolution, enhancing the overall water supply experience.

4. **Resource Conservation:** By providing users with accurate water supply information, our system encourages responsible water storage and usage, reducing unnecessary wastage.

5. **Integrated Platform:** Our project integrates all aspects of water supply management, from scheduling to billing, onto a single online platform. This integration minimizes errors, enhances accuracy, and ensures seamless user experiences.

**Advantages:**

- **Efficiency:** The system streamlines water supply information dissemination, reducing confusion and enhancing resource utilization.
- **Transparency:** Users gain access to accurate billing information and contractor contacts, promoting transparency and trust.
- **Convenience:** Online bill payment and direct contact information improve user convenience and engagement.
- **Conservation:** Real-time supply updates encourage responsible water usage, contributing to resource conservation.
- **Error Reduction:** Automation minimizes manual errors in scheduling and billing processes.
- **Future Scalability:** The project serves as the foundational framework for the "Jal in One" mobile app, which extends these advantages to a broader audience.

In conclusion, our DBMS project lays the groundwork for the "Jal in One" mobile app, offering a robust solution to water supply challenges. By automating scheduling, billing, and contact information, we enhance water management efficiency, user convenience, and resource conservation. This comprehensive platform sets the stage for a more sustainable and user-friendly water supply system.
